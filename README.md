# Cycle extraction
Demo code for extracting cycles from spatiotemporal data using transfer operators.
Examples are (i) the Lorenz63 system, which detects the main "around the wings" cycle, and (ii) detection of the El-Nino Southern Oscillation from 50 years of reconstructed sea-surface temperature readings in the Indo-Pacific https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/extended-reconstructed-sea-surface-temperature-ersst-v4
